# Apty

## Mission

Empower people to improve their homes and communities

## Vision

A home is more than a house. A community is more than a set of buildings.

Apty provides a platform for people and APIs to plug in, both by providing data and services.  For users, we use this data to power user experiences that improve their lives and their communities. Apty provides a basic set of services necessary to empower a single home, a building, or a set of buildings to be able to share information, when and as needed.
